This study will unfold in two distinct segments. The initial phase will be focused on developing a model using item-to-item collaborative filtering. This approach will leverage similarities and patterns among movies to make rating predictions. In the ensuing segment, the study will pivot to user-to-user collaborative filtering. This alternative method hinges on inter-user relationships for prediction purposes.

In employing both methodologies, we aim to understand their comparative effectiveness and suitability in the context of our particular dataset. Furthermore, this dual approach will provide insights into the nuances of both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering in a recommender system context.
